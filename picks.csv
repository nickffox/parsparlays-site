2,,10/3/2025,Iowa St. +1.5,4,NCAAF,"Support Matt!!! Cincinnati barely beat Kansas last week. Iowa St. is a better team, they should win outright. "
3,,10/3/2025,Georgia -20.5,5,NCAAF,Georgia comes in angry from their loss to Bama last week. Blows out a Kentucky team that is not that good. Georgia has also won against KY @ home by 28+ points in like the last 5 meetings
4,,10/3/2025,Louisville -6.5,3,NCAAF,"Virigina coming in from an emotional win last week, might be a let down week as all the kids out getting some. Louisville is a very very good team. At home look for cardinals to cover the TD spread"
5,,10/3/2025,Texas -4.5,3,NCAAF,"Florida is not very good and has just had a horrid tough schedule. Texas coming off bye should win easily. Only thing possibly is Texas looking ahead to the Oklahoma game next week. Maybe they underestimate FL and stumble, but they should be good to win at least by 3. The under is also in play in you want."
